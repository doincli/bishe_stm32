 *  @brief   TX then wait for response example code
 *
 *           This is a simple code example that sends a frame and then turns on the DW1000 receiver to receive a response. The response could be
 *           anything as no check is performed on it and it is only displayed in a local buffer but the sent frame is the one expected by the
 *           companion simple example "RX then send a response example code". After the response is received or if the reception timeouts, this code
 *           just go back to the sending of a new frame.

/*****************************************************************************************************************************************************
 * NOTES:
 *
 * 1. The device ID is a hard coded constant in the blink to keep the example simple but for a real product every device should have a unique ID.
 *    For development purposes it is possible to generate a DW1000 unique ID by combining the Lot ID & Part Number values programmed into the
 *    DW1000 during its manufacture. However there is no guarantee this will not conflict with someone else�s implementation. We recommended that
 *    customers buy a block of addresses from the IEEE Registration Authority for their production items. See "EUI" in the DW1000 User Manual.
 * 2. TX to RX delay can be set to 0 to activate reception immediately after transmission. But, on the responder side, it takes time to process the
 *    received frame and generate the response (this has been measured experimentally to be around 70 �s). Using an RX to TX delay slightly less than
 *    this minimum turn-around time allows the application to make the communication efficient while reducing power consumption by adjusting the time
 *    spent with the receiver activated.
 * 3. This timeout is for complete reception of a frame, i.e. timeout duration must take into account the length of the expected frame. Here the value
 *    is arbitrary but chosen large enough to make sure that there is enough time to receive a complete frame sent by the "RX then send a response"
 *    example at the 110k data rate used (around 3 ms).
 * 4. In this example, maximum frame length is set to 127 bytes which is 802.15.4 UWB standard maximum frame length. DW1000 supports an extended frame
 *    length (up to 1023 bytes long) mode which is not used in this example.
 * 5. In this example, LDE microcode is not loaded upon calling dwt_initialise(). This will prevent the IC from generating an RX timestamp. If
 *    time-stamping is required, DWT_LOADUCODE parameter should be used. See two-way ranging examples (e.g. examples 5a/5b).
 * 6. In a real application, for optimum performance within regulatory limits, it may be necessary to set TX pulse bandwidth and TX power, (using
 *    the dwt_configuretxrf API call) to per device calibrated values saved in the target system or the DW1000 OTP memory.
 * 7. dwt_writetxdata() takes the full size of tx_msg as a parameter but only copies (size - 2) bytes as the check-sum at the end of the frame is
 *    automatically appended by the DW1000. This means that our tx_msg could be two bytes shorter without losing any data (but the sizeof would not
 *    work anymore then as we would still have to indicate the full length of the frame to dwt_writetxdata()).
 * 8. We use polled mode of operation here to keep the example as simple as possible but all status events can be used to generate interrupts. Please
 *    refer to DW1000 User Manual for more details on "interrupts".
 * 9. The user is referred to DecaRanging ARM application (distributed with EVK1000 product) for additional practical example of usage, and to the
 *    DW1000 API Guide for more details on the DW1000 driver functions.
